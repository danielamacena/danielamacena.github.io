                                    <p>
                                        While business decision-makers are exploiting the deluge of data sets to transform the for-profit world, nonprofit leaders are taking advantage of big data analytics to expand their humanitarian missions.
                                        We can make use of big data analytics to achieve two general objectives: predict patterns of donor behavior and use data-driven analysis to develop marketing strategies and plans.
                                                                            </p>

                                    <h3>BIG ONES LITTLE ONES Inc. (BOLO)</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Just like UNICEF that offers data to the public on its website, allowing people to see how statistics are improving over time, BIG ONES LITTLE ONES (BOLO) is moving toward the possibility of incorporating big data into its work because they believe that viewing the data for themselves might encourage individuals to give generously when it is time for fundraising campaigns.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        BOLO operates a visual art/literacy program and uses arts and storytelling to engage with participants. It is open to all children, including those who may have special needs or who are disadvantaged, such as, children living in War Zones.

                                        The International Children's Program released in 2004 want to expand their program based on evidence and analytics in order to outreach to attract donations and attention for a cause, as well as identifying how best to use the money and improve marketing strategies.



                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is a lot of data to manage, such as fundraising, marketing, programs, program outcomes and campaign performance. These can cover monthly cash flow trends and donor demographics for example. If actionable insights are properly utilized, it can serve as a transparent display to supporters that their donations are making an impact on the organization.

                                        <br /> <br />To get the most out of data analytics, we are ensuring we are collecting as much data as possible. Obtaining the contact information, donor’s name, address, age and etc.
                                        Moreover, donors will be surveyed over time to extract biographical details that can be used to shape strategy and unlock insights in order to determine when the proper time to launch a fundraising campaign is, and develop statistical models using segmentation and predictive modeling to help us identify and target the right groups, so that we can develop a more refined marketing strategy.  

                                    </p>

                                    <p>

                                        Another part of this project is to rebuild the BOLO Website. The main feature is being developed is to capture data about user behavior on their website. For example, if potential donors are leaving the website on specific pages, take necessary action to improve it. Leverage data to make sure each web page is functional in order to convert as many website visitors into donors as possible.

                                    </p>

People came and fed the fish and prayed over the water for the fish to be safe. People lit fires to sit around to talk about the fish and the turtle.
